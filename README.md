# avatarquiz

This is a web app quiz I created using Python - Flask.
The quiz is about the TV show - Avatar the last airbender.

link to the web app - https://avatarquiz.herokuapp.com/

This app was built as part of Yam Mesicka's python course.

I uploaoded all the project files except of the pictures.
The main illustration of Aang was illustrated by me in Adobe illustrator.
Most of the pictures in the quiz itself were taken from the TV series and I took them from Avatar Wiki.

I also want to give attention to Corey Schafer for his Pyhon Flask tutorials which helped me during this project.

I changed the 'avatar_questions.csv' file before upload it to Github so there will be only a few questions for example. 
I didnt want to ruin the quiz fun by revealing the answers.
