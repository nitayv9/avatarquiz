# Introduction

I am excited to present my personal projectâ€”an engaging web application that revolves around Avatar TV show trivia. This project was developed outside of the classroom (before I started my degree) and serves as a platform for me to showcase my programming skills and passion.

Using Python-Flask, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL Database, sqlalchemy, and jinja, I built a dynamic web app that seamlessly integrates front-end and back-end functionalities. The code incorporates dynamic programming and other fundamental computer science concepts to ensure efficiency and performance.

The web app is designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly, allowing users to enjoy the trivia game on various devices. The concept is simple: users register, play the game, answer Avatar-related questions, earn points for correct answers, and compete with other users to secure a place on the top 10 leaderboard.

Join me on this exciting journey and put your Avatar knowledge to the test. Let's aim for the top 10 board and become the ultimate players in the database!

Thank you for your interest in my project. Together, let's celebrate the world of Avatar and enjoy the thrill of trivia!

# Credits
Most of the pictures in the quiz were taken from the TV series and sourced from the Avatar Wiki.
The main illustration of Aang was designed by me using Adobe Illustrator.

I want to give a shoutout to Corey Schafer for his Python Flask tutorials that helped me during this project (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH).

Please note that the 'avatar_questions.csv' file is not the full file used to initiate the database in the 'behind_the_scenes.py' file. I chose not to include the full file to preserve the integrity of the quiz and the fun of the game.

The web app was powered by Heroku until January 16, 2023, but due to new policies, it is now powered by Render.
