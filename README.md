# avatarquiz

This is a web app quiz that I created using Python and Flask.
The quiz is based on the TV show "Avatar: The Last Airbender."
You can access the web app at - https://avatarquiz.onrender.com.

I created this app as part of a Python course by Yam Mesicka.

Most of the pictures in the quiz were taken from the TV series and sourced from the Avatar Wiki.
The main illustration of Aang was designed by me using Adobe Illustrator.

I want to give a shoutout to Corey Schafer for his Python Flask tutorials that helped me during this project (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH).

Please note that the 'avatar_questions.csv' file is not the full file used to initiate the database in the 'behind_the_scenes.py' file.
I chose not to include the full file to preserve the integrity of the quiz and the fun of the game.

The web app was powered by Heroku until January 16, 2023, but due to new policies, it is now powered by Render.
